## Requirements

The environment dependencies required to execute the code are outlined in the `requirements.txt`.

## Usage

- To utilize the SVM-SelectKBest model, execute the `SVM-SelectKBest\SVM_SelectKBest.py`.
- To utilize the SensoryAttentionNet model, execute the `SensoryAttentionNet\SensoryAttentionNet.py`. And The outcomes of the model run will be stored in the `SensoryAttentionNet\results\`.
- The data required to execute the code is stored in the file `Data\OilSourceGeochemicalData.xlsx`.
